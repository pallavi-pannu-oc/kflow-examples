Maybe I should have noted that earlier when talking about attatching volumes, beacuse if you thougth I was doing that to a function, you'd probably think me quite insane. \n",

    "\n",
    "The trick for the most part is to create a function that returns a `kfp.dsl.ContainerOp`.  This will point to an image, note the volumes that need to be mounted, and a number of other things. I've heard told people don't always just like creating absurdly large and fat functions to do everything in real life, so I leave this hear as an aside in case the reader is interested in it.  It's alsow worth noting that adding the `@kfp.dsl.component` annotation instructs teh Kubeflow compiler to turn on static typce checking. \n",

    "    image='gcr.io/path/to/container/image'\n",
    "  )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when it comes to incorporating these components into pipelines, you would do something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "@kfp.dsl.pipeline(\n",
    "  name='My pipeline',\n",
    "  description='My machine learning pipeline'\n",

    "def my_pipeline(param_1: PipelineParam, param_2: PipelineParam):\n",
    "  my_step = my_component(my_param='a')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which should look exceedingly familiar as we did something very similar with our `download_data_fn` and `witchcraft_fn`.  "
